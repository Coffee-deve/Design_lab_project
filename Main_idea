"Personal Media Server Project with Raspberry Pi"

Goal: to transform the Raspberry Pi into a server that hosts and streams media such as videos, music, and photos to other devices on the same network. It can serve as a central hub for all digital media in a home.

Components:
Raspberry Pi (model 3B+ I believe)
Micro SD Card
External Hard Drive or a large capacity USB drive (for storing media files)
HDMI Cable and monitor (for initial setup)
optionally keyboard, mouse, additional mictroprocessor for sharing data

For the server: plex or selfwritten webserver
